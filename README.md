# *Plasmodium vivax* AmpliSeq Analysis Pipeline - BETA

## Background

This git repo hosts a BETA version of code for analysis of *Plasmodium vivax* data generated using an AmpliSeq design that amplifies 495 targets covering 415 unique targets across all 14 chromosomes of the *P. vivax* genome ([BED File](./AmpliSeq_Design.bed)). The analysis goal is the following:
    
1) Identify 'same-strain' infections of *P. vivax* (in other words, closely related clusters),

2) Prediction of *P. vivax* samples to a geographic region,

3) Identify SNPs in proposed drug-resistance markers in *P. vivax*.

Please cite the following paper when referencing this workflow:

`Genetic characterization of Plasmodium vivax linked to autochthonous malaria transmission in the US (2023) using Illumina AmpliSeq technology: a genetic epidemiology study by Dr Joel Barratt. Barratt et al 2024. Submitted to The Lancet Microbe`



## Requirements for Running Pipeline

### Software Dependencies
nextflow
    
    update config

singularity

    Access to containers

### Additional Installation Steps

**Train Geographic Prediction Model**

Add in steps for this

**Reference Database Creation**

A handful of reference files need to be downloaded/unzipped/made for running the pipeline. Follow the directions below.

Navigate to the `pvivax_ampliseq_analysis/REFERENCES/pv_geo_refs/` subfolder and run the following code. This will create a bowtie2 database for each target amplicon.

    ls *fasta | awk -F "." '{print$1}' | while read line; do bowtie2-build $line.fasta $line\_bt2 ; done

Navigate to the `pvivax_ampliseq_analysis/REFERENCES` folder and download and then unzip a human reference genome (instructions borrowed from [metagenomics.wiki](https://www.metagenomics.wiki/tools/short-read/remove-host-sequences)).

    wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/bt/GRCh38_noalt_as.zip

    unzip GRCh38_noalt_as.zip

Navigate to the `pvivax_ampliseq_analysis/HAPLOTYPE_CALLER_PVIVAX/` folder and unzip the REF_SEQS folder

    unzip REF_SEQS.zip

Navigate to the `pvivax_ampliseq_analysis/Eukaryotpying-Python-main/` folder and unzip the haplotype reference database.

    unzip PVIVAX_REF_GENOTYPES.zip

**Check the readme.txt files**

The following folders are pre-populated with txt files describing the contents of that folder. Read those files to ascertain the contents of each folder when the workflow runs.



**Template for clearance: This project serves as a template to aid projects in starting up and moving through clearance procedures. To start, create a new repository and implement the required [open practices](open_practices.md), train on and agree to adhere to the organization's [rules of behavior](rules_of_behavior.md), and [send a request through the create repo form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=aQjnnNtg_USr6NJ2cHf8j44WSiOI6uNOvdWse4I-C2NUNk43NzMwODJTRzA4NFpCUk1RRU83RTFNVi4u) using language from this template as a Guide.**

readme files in folders



run test data?

probably need to retrain a classifier but not sure? Would need a beta tester. Can provide instructions for creating model

I need to update the report generation aspects of the code in a way that make sense for newest versions of code

pvivax metadata xlsx sheet, maybe have an empty format?
    pvivax_metadata.xlsx is the default in the config. Uploaded example under pvivax_metadata_github.xlsx name

Explain that region prediction results are best for pvivax geo prediction

Explain where results will go

## Code examples

Copy options from qsub script?
